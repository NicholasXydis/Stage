## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-01

First release. Stage collects CS internship postings from company job boards
and community feeds, keeps the ones a CS undergraduate can apply to, and stores
them in a SQLite database on your own machine.

### What it does

- **Reads 1,450+ employers** across 15 ATS platforms — Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby,
  Workday, SmartRecruiters, Workable and more — through 13 adapters, plus 11
  community feeds.
- **Filters hard.** It has kept 4,165 postings and rejected 134,368. Senior
  roles, graduate-only research posts and work outside Canada and the United
  States are all rejected. A posting whose location cannot be read is kept,
  since a board that publishes no place is missing data rather than advertising
  a foreign one. Every rejection records the rule that caught it, so
  `stage quarantine` shows what was skipped and why.
- **Classifies each posting** by role, internship scope, degree eligibility,
  location and language, in English and French. Filter with `--role`,
  `--location`, `--term`, `--lang`, `--source` and `--company`, and narrow by
  date with `--last`.
- **Browses from the terminal.** `stage list`, `stage search`, and a full-screen
  `stage tui`. Rows are numbered, so `stage show 3` and `stage open 3 5 9` act
  on what you just saw. The TUI keeps its filters in one panel, marks rows with
  `space` to open them together, and switches theme with `ctrl+t`.
- **Exports** to CSV, JSON, Markdown or PDF.
- **Runs on a schedule** through launchd, systemd or Task Scheduler, and can
  post new postings to a Discord channel through a webhook.
- **Stays polite.** Requests are rate limited per host, cached with validators,
  and backed off when a board pushes back. A cooldown longer than the retry
  ceiling stops the run for that host rather than hammering it.
- **Stays local.** No account, no server, no telemetry. The only network traffic
  is Stage reading public job boards.

### Requirements

Python 3.12, 3.13 or 3.14 on macOS, Linux or Windows.
